# Article Summary
The article claims that the most challenging aspect of software development is not the coding itself, but rather defining and managing requirements. These requirements are vital because they guide the development process and ensure that the final product meets users' needs. Poorly defined requirements can lead to significant issues like scope creep, wasted resources, and overall poor products. Additionally, it underscores the importance of effective communication and collaboration between stakeholders and developers to define requirements. Agile methods are recommended for managing evolving requirements, so that user needs and project goals can stay the focal point. The article also warns against using AI too much in the development process.

# Comments - Andrew Qin
This was a very insightful article, because I think people often overlook the planning and design aspect of software development (myself included), which as the article stated often leads to wasted time and resources. It also provides a good explanation to why AI can't entirely replace software engineers yet, which much of the population thinks will happen very soon.
